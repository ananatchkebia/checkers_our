#‚ôü Checkers Game (Python + Pygame + AI)

This is a graphical Checkers (Draughts) game built with Python and Pygame(but partial game, it's not completed). It allows you to play against AI, for this I used MCTS algorithm. The game implements basic rules of checkers including normal moves and captures.

 ‚ö†Ô∏è This project is still in development. It was originally written as a learning exercise and may contain bugs or incomplete features.

 ## üéÆ Features

- Pygame-powered graphical interface
- playing against AI 
- Highlighting valid moves
- Piece capturing logic(even several following capturing logic, if there is such case)

## Technlogies used

- Python programming language to implement game logics
- Pygame library for graphical interface
- Monte Carlo Search Tree AI algorithm to make possible play against AI

## Future improvements

- write Queen's moves logic
- define winning conditions
- make sure that everything works right and there aren't unexpected bugs

## How to run and see game

you can use any IDE that supports Python programming language. Ensure you have python installed and all requered python libraries, clone the repository Run checkers_our.py file 
you will see pygame window, that shows checker's board and make move with red piece(click on piece and you will see all possible moves on the board), then it's time to make move from AI and it 
will be done automatically...enjoy game and feel free to contribute in it:)
